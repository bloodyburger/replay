# Replay

Replay is an open and permissionless subchain that allows individuals to participate as Validator nodes to support the tracking protocol.

Solo staking in the Replay Subchain involves running a validator node connected to the internet and depositing a specified amount of RPLAY tokens to activate the validator. By solo staking, you directly participate in the network’s consensus mechanism, contributing to its decentralization and security. This guide will walk you through the process of setting up and running a Replay Subchain Validator.

If you need assistance during the setup process or have any questions, please don’t hesitate to contact our support team via Discord(#validator-support) or email at [support@imaginereplay.org](mailto:support@imaginereplay.org). We are dedicated to helping the community make Replay more decentralized and are happy to assist you along the way.

One of the main advantages of solo staking is the level of control it offers. When you solo stake, you retain full control over your staked tokens and the setup of your validator. You maintain ownership of your own keys, enabling you to choose the combination of clients and hardware that aligns with your risk tolerance and contributes to the network’s health and security.

Before opting for solo staking, it’s important to consider certain factors. These include being comfortable with computers, possessing the necessary technical knowledge to operate hardware and software components effectively, secure key management, regular maintenance of the node, reliable uptime, and understanding the potential slashing risks associated with validator misbehavior. For more details on these considerations, please refer to the Theta Metachain whitepaper.

Before staking with real tokens, it is advisable to test your setup and operational skills by setting up a validator that connects to the Replay Subchain TestNet.

## How to Run a Replay Validator

You need to have a machine with following requirements and periodically monitor if all the processes are running as expected. These are recommended by Theta team to run a validator as part of Replay sub chain:

**Hardware Minimum requirements:**
- Memory: 16 GB RAM
- CPU: 8 cores
- Storage Disk: 1 TB SSD
- Network Bandwidth: 200Mbps symmetrical commercial network
- Operating System: Ubuntu

In addition to the hardware requirements, you will need the following tokens as well:
- 1000 wTheta: If you have THETA tokens, they can be wrapped on the Theta Wallet.
- 20,000 TFUEL + additional to cover gas fees : This amount is required to cover cross-chain transfers that require TFUEL. Additional gas fees is to perform deposit stake transaction.
- At least 1 RPLAY token :)

Please ensure that you have the necessary hardware and tokens before proceeding with the validator setup.

Now that we have covered the introduction and hardware requirements, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of setting up and running a Replay Subchain Validator. Please refer to [Solo Staking](https://github.com/imaginereplay/replay/blob/main/docs/SoloStaking.md).
